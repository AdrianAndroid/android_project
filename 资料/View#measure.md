     * <p>
     * Measure the view and its content to determine the measured width and the
     * measured height. This method is invoked by {@link #measure(int, int)} and
     * should be overridden by subclasses to provide accurate and efficient
     * measurement of their contents.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * <strong>CONTRACT:</strong> When overriding this method, you
     * <em>must</em> call {@link #setMeasuredDimension(int, int)} to store the
     * measured width and height of this view. Failure to do so will trigger an
     * <code>IllegalStateException</code>, thrown by
     * {@link #measure(int, int)}. Calling the superclass'
     * {@link #onMeasure(int, int)} is a valid use.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The base class implementation of measure defaults to the background size,
     * unless a larger size is allowed by the MeasureSpec. Subclasses should
     * override {@link #onMeasure(int, int)} to provide better measurements of
     * their content.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * If this method is overridden, it is the subclass's responsibility to make
     * sure the measured height and width are at least the view's minimum height
     * and width ({@link #getSuggestedMinimumHeight()} and
     * {@link #getSuggestedMinimumWidth()}).
     * </p>

     *                         {@link android.view.View.MeasureSpec}.
     * @param heightMeasureSpec vertical space requirements as imposed by the parent.
     *                         The requirements are encoded with
